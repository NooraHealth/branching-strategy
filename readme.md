# Branching strategy

A branching strategy is a critical component of a software development workflow. It defines a structured method for how branches should be created, used, merged, and managed within version control systems like Git. A well-defined branching strategy helps maintain order, improves development efficiency, and reduces conflicts between parallel development efforts. Below are several popular branching strategies that are widely adopted in various types of projects

## Types of branching strategy

1. [Git Flow](#git-flow)
1. [GitHub Flow](#github-flow)
1. [GitLab Flow](#gitlab-flow)
1. [Trunk-Based Development](#trunk-based-development)

## Git Flow 

Git Flow is one of the most common branching strategies, particularly suited for projects with scheduled release cycles. It involves multiple branches for managing different levels of stability and various project phases:
1. Main Branches:
    1. master: Always reflects a production-ready state.
    1. develop: Serves as an integration branch for features.
1. Supporting Branches:
    1. Feature branches: Branch off from develop and merge back into develop when they are complete.
    1. Release branches: Branch off from develop and are used to prepare a new production release. They allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release.
    1. Hotfix branches: Branch from master and are used to quickly patch production releases. Once the hotfix is complete, it is merged into both master and develop (or the current release branch).
 
### When to Use Git Flow

1. Git Flow is particularly beneficial in larger, structured development environments where multiple streams of development occur simultaneously, rigorous quality assurance is needed, and release schedules are defined.
1. Itâ€™s well-suited for projects that require maintaining multiple versions of the software simultaneously.

### Pros

1. Structured Approach
1. Support for Multiple Versions
1. Enhanced Quality Control
1. Clear Role Assignments
1. Parallel Development

 ### Cons

 1. Complexity
 1. Overhead
 1. Merge Challenges
 1. Continuous Deployment Challenges

## GitHub Flow

GitHub Flow is a simpler alternative to Git Flow and is better suited for projects that deploy regularly. It's lightweight and easier to manage:

1. Single Main Branch:
    1. main or master: Always holds the production-ready state.
1. Feature Branches:
    1. Developers create new branches for features or fixes from the main branch.
    1. Once the feature is ready, it is submitted as a pull request for review.
    1. After review, it is merged into the main branch and deployed.

### Pros
1. Simplicity
1. Continuous Integration and Deployment
1. Collaboration and Review
1. Rapid Feedback
1. Reduced Risk of Integration Issues

### Cons

1. Lack of Explicit Structure for Larger Teams
1. Overemphasis on Continuous Deployment 
1. Potential for Master Branch Instability
1. Handling Hotfixes
1. Versioning Challenges

## GitLab Flow

GitLab Flow combines feature-driven development and feature branching with issue tracking. It is an extension of GitHub Flow but adds an environment-based approach where the environment stability increases as you move the code from left (less stable, development) to right (more stable, production):

1. Environment Branches:
production, pre-production, staging, etc.: These branches reflect environments.
1. Feature Branches:
    1. Similar to GitHub Flow, features are developed in separate branches based on the main branch (master or main).
    1. Feature branches are merged into the next environment branch (e.g., staging) and eventually up to production.

### Pros

1. Environment Branches
1. Flexibility
1. Integration with GitLab CI/CD
1. Enhanced Review and Quality Control
1. Visibility and Traceability

### Cons

1. Complexity for Smaller Teams
1. Requires Rigorous Discipline
1. Dependency on GitLab
1. Overhead in Managing Multiple Branches
1. Training and Onboarding

## Trunk-Based Development

Trunk-Based Development is a strategy designed for continuous integration, where developers work in short-lived branches or directly in the trunk:
1. Single Branch:
    1. trunk or main: The main development branch and the single source of truth for the project.
1. Short-lived Feature Branches:
    1. Developers create branches for features, but these branches are very short-lived, typically merged back into the main branch within a day or two.

### Pros

1. Simplicity
1. Rapid Feedback Loop
1. Avoids Merge Hell
1. Facilitates Continuous Delivery
1. Enhanced Collaboration

### Cons

1. Requires Automated Testing
1. High Discipline and Coordination
1. Potential for Breaking Changes
1. Scale Challenges
1. Continuous Monitoring Required

## Things to consider

When selecting a branching strategy, consider the following factors:

1. Project Size: Larger projects with multiple teams might benefit from a more structured approach like Git Flow.
1. Release Cycle: Frequent, smaller releases often fit better with GitHub Flow or Trunk-Based Development.
1. Team Workflow: Consider how your team works and their familiarity with the chosen strategy.
1. Tooling: Some version control systems might integrate better with specific workflows, influencing the choice of strategy.

The right branching strategy can streamline your development process, reduce errors, and help manage releases efficiently. Always tailor the strategy to fit your project's needs and team dynamics.
