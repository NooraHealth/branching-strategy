# Our Branching Strategy 

Our branching strategy is a mix of two branching strategy git flow and github flow


1. Main Branches:
    1. main/prod: Always reflects a production-ready state.
1. Supporting Branches:
    1. staging: Serves as an integration branch for features.
    1. develop: Serves as an integration branch for features.
    1. Feature branches: Branch off from develop and merge back into develop when they are complete.
